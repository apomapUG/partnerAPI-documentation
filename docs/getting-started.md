##### GETTING STARTED

---

Our API allows clients to read and modify data stored in our database. This page documents how to write a valid API request, how authorization scopes are applied, and how complex or custom queries and mutations can be written and executed. Furthermore, this page describes how we structured our data in schema, types and definitions. However, you can also obtain this information via [introspection](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/).

---

If you are already familiar with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and quickly want to test our API, you can do this with [GraphQL Playground](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v2/testing/graphql-playground/). Here are some resources to help - [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/public/graphiql) and [Complete guide to GraphQL Playground](https://blog.logrocket.com/complete-guide-to-graphql-playground/).
