##### Introduction

The apomap partner API is based on [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs. Unlike standard REST APIs, GraphQL gives you the ultimate flexibility to specify in your API requests what data you need and get back precisely that.

If you are new to GraphQL, please take some time to familiarize yourself with some basic GraphQL concepts before digging into our documentation. We recommend these resources to get you started -[Introduction to GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) and [How to GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/).
